# Network-Attack-detection-LSTM
Network intrusion detection part 1 

Network Intrusion Detection Model using an RNN-CNN â€“ we conducted the research in 2 parts: 
1. The first part included using various machine learning ensemble algorithms on the KDD (knowledge discovery dataset) and 2. 
2. The second part was using the raw network traffic data provided by Palo alto networks, California. 
3. We converted the Raw network packet data into streams and fed it to the RNN to extract temporal features which were in turn used to make images given to the CNN to detect anomalie
